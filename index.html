            <h3>How We Met</h3>
            <p>Michael spotted Darshna at a summer house party and did... absolutely nothing. Lucky for them, fast forward four months to a NYE house party (that neither of them planned to attend), their paths crossed again and they spent hours talking away.</p>
            
            <p>Like a true gentleman, he walked her to the station. And like a true millennial, he didn't ask for her number but slid into her Instagram DMs the next day.</p>
            
            <h4>The First Date</h4>
            <p>Michael chose the elegant Bluebird Chelsea for their first date, clearly pulling out all the stops! Still recovering from the flu, Darshna kept disappearing to the ladies' room—apparently blowing your nose on a first date isn't very romantic. After the 10th time, Michael, with his signature dry humor, told her she may as well take her bag with her if she was planning to make a run for it.</p>
            
            <p class="story-ending">That has since changed and now he holds the tissue box for her ❤️</p>

            <h3>Two Cultures, One Love</h3>
            <p>Our love story is beautifully woven with traditions from both our cultures. Darshna brings the rich heritage of Indian customs, while Michael embraces these traditions with an open heart.</p>
            <p>This Indian wedding celebration honors Darshna's family traditions and allows us to share the beauty of Indian customs with all our loved ones.</p>

            <h3>Why Two Celebrations?</h3>
            <p>We chose to have two wedding celebrations to honor both our backgrounds and give our families the opportunity to celebrate in ways that are meaningful to them.</p>
            <p>Our Indian wedding will feature traditional ceremonies, vibrant colors, and customs that have been passed down through generations in Darshna's family.</p>
