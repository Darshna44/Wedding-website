            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <h3>How We Met</h3>
            <p>Michael spotted Darshna at a summer house party and did... absolutely nothing. Lucky for them, fast forward four months to a NYE house party (that neither of them planned to attend), their paths crossed again and they spent hours talking away.</p>
            
            <p>Like a true gentleman, he walked her to the station. And like a true millennial, he didn't ask for her number but slid into her Instagram DMs the next day.</p>
            
            <h3>The First Date</h3>
            <p>Michael chose the elegant Bluebird Chelsea for their first date, clearly pulling out all the stops! Still recovering from the flu, Darshna kept disappearing to the ladies' room‚Äîapparently blowing your nose on a first date isn't very romantic. After the 10th time, Michael, with his signature dry humor, told her she may as well take her bag with her if she was planning to make a run for it.</p>
            
            <p><em>That has since changed and now he holds the tissue box for her ‚ù§Ô∏è</em></p>
